Elevator
========

A simple class meant to simulate an elavtor

Improvements/Notes/Missing Features
------
A way to check/simulate if the elevator is currently in motion and has gotten to its floor

Maybe use method missing instead of define_method

If an up button is pressed, then it gets to that floor and a person trys to go down, dont let it

Smart queing if the elavator is called from floors 20, 30, and 10 in that order, go to the floors in the logical order 10,20,30
